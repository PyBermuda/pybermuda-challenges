SORTING

There are many different ways to sort a list. Some are more efficient than others.

Python provides a couple of ways to sort a list. The most common way is to use the built-in `sort` method on
the list directly. This method sorts the list in place. You can also use the `sorted` function which returns a new
sorted list without modifying the original list.

The purpose of this exercise, however, is to have you write your own sorting algorithm. The algorithm should take a list
and an order parameter. The order parameter can be either "asc" for ascending order or "desc" for descending order.

Here are some good places to look for sorting algorithms:
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort

Google is your friend. Look up these algorithms and try to implement one of them.

You cannot use the built-in `sort` method or the `sorted` function. You must write your own sorting algorithm.

This excercise will introduce the concept of unit tests, and algorithm complexity.

The unit tests can be found in the file 003/test_sort.py

To run the tests simply run `pytest` in the terminal (after having done `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

def manual_sort(list: list, *, order: str) -> int:
    """
    Sorts a list in ascending or descending order based on the given order parameter.

    Args:
        list: The list to be sorted.
        order: The order in which to sort the list. Can be either "asc" for ascending order or "desc" for descending order.

    Returns:
        The sorted list.
