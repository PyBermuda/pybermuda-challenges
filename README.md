# PyBermuda Challenges

This repository contains scripts for small Python challenges to try, and subsequently discuss, at PyBermuda meetups.

It is recommended that you [fork this repository](https://github.com/PyBermuda/pybermuda-challenges/fork) and keep a the copy on your own GitHub account. [harrymunro](https://github.com/harrymunro) kindly [shared a guide](https://jarv.is/notes/how-to-pull-request-fork-github/) on how to do this ðŸ˜Š

## Environment

It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment to run these challenges. To create a new virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

To activate the virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

To deactivate the virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
deactivate
```

There are other ways to create and manage virtual environments, but this is the simplest way to get started. Check out `pyenv`, `conda`, or `poetry` to learn more.

## Installing dependencies

To install the dependencies for all challenges, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If, on the way through, you add a new dependency, you can update the `requirements.txt` file by running:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
