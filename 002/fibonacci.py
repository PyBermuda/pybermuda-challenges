NOT TERRIBLE FIBONACCI

I am sure I don't need to tell you that the Fibonacci sequence is a series of
numbers in which each numbers, starting with 0 and 1, where each value is the
sum of the two preceding ones.

The first 10 values are as follows.

Example Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

Your task is to complete the `fibonacci` function below so that it will return
the 40th number in the sequence *in less than 0.5s*. 

NO YOU CANNOT JUST RETURN THE NUMBER 63,245,986 - the function must accept a
single argument `n`, and return the nth number in the sequence.

To get you started, it *might* be a good idea to make `fibonacci` a recursive
function: but note that this alone probably won't be able to perform the
calculation in less than 0.5s (unless you have a very powerful machine).
A clue to making it faster would be: each call to the (recursive) `fibonacci`
function will likely result in 2 further calls to the function (to get the
previous two numbers). This will result in a large number of calls to
retrieve the same number in the sequence. What if the function could remember
previous calculations it had performed?
